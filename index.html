      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        Mathematics remains a gateway subject for science, technology, and economic participation,
        yet many Nigerian students continue to perform below expectations. Why do students in the
        same schools—and often the same classrooms—experience Mathematics so differently?
      </p>
      <p>
        This study centers the voices of learners themselves. Drawing on survey data from 240 senior
        secondary school students in Ethiope East Local Government Area, Delta State, Nigeria, it
        examines how students perceive the influence of parental education, teacher experience,
        teacher qualifications, socioeconomic background, and cultural-linguistic context on their
        academic performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Findings indicate that teacher quality and family economic support are perceived as the most
        influential factors, while cultural background and parental occupation are viewed as far less
        determinative. These results challenge deficit-based narratives and highlight the need for
        equity-focused educational policy and teacher development.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Study Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In Nigeria, poor performance in Mathematics is often explained in simple terms: students are
        weak, parents are uneducated, or culture is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        But these explanations rarely ask the most important question:
        <strong>What do students themselves believe is shaping their learning?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This research treats student perception not as opinion, but as evidence. Students experience
        classrooms daily, navigate family constraints, and interact directly with teachers. Their
        perspectives offer a grounded, human lens for improving Mathematics education.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Research Context</h2>
      <p>
        The study was conducted in Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State, a region that
        includes both semi-urban and rural communities. Schools in this area face uneven access to
        qualified teachers, limited instructional resources, and wide socioeconomic differences
        among students’ families.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>How the Study Was Conducted</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Descriptive survey research</li>
        <li><strong>Participants:</strong> 240 Senior Secondary School Two (SSS2) students</li>
        <li><strong>Schools:</strong> Six public secondary schools</li>
        <li><strong>Instrument:</strong> Structured questionnaire across five domains</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Descriptive and inferential statistics</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Findings</h2>

      <h3>Teacher Quality Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Students consistently identified teacher experience and professional qualification as major
        influences on Mathematics performance.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        While qualified teachers were seen as more effective, they were not automatically seen as
        making students love Mathematics.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Family Income Shapes Opportunity</h3>
      <p>
        Low family income was strongly associated with difficulty accessing textbooks, learning
        materials, and stable study environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Culture Is Not the Villain</h3>
      <p>
        Students rejected the idea that speaking local languages or having farming parents leads to
        poor performance, challenging long-standing cultural-deficit narratives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Mathematics achievement is not only an academic issue—it is a social and structural one.
        When students speak, they consistently point to teacher quality, economic support, and fair
        learning conditions rather than culture or identity.
