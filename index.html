            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Mathematics remains a gateway subject for science, technology, and economic participation, yet many Nigerian students continue to perform below expectations. Why do students in the same schools—and often the same classrooms—experience Mathematics so differently?</p>
            
            <p>This study explores that question by centering the voices of learners themselves. Drawing on survey data from 240 senior secondary school students in Ethiope East Local Government Area, Delta State, Nigeria, the research examines how students perceive the influence of parental education, teacher experience, teacher qualifications, socioeconomic background, and cultural-linguistic context on their academic performance.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Findings show that teacher quality and family economic support are perceived as the most influential factors, while cultural background and parental occupation are viewed as far less determinative.</strong> These results challenge deficit-based narratives and highlight the need for equity-focused educational policy and teacher development.</p>

    <!-- Context -->
    <section>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Why This Study Matters</h2>
            <p>In Nigeria, poor performance in Mathematics is often explained in simple terms: <em>students are weak</em>, <em>parents are uneducated</em>, or <em>culture is the problem</em>.</p>
            
            <p>But these explanations rarely ask the most important question:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>What do students themselves believe is shaping their learning?</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This research takes student perception seriously—not as opinion, but as evidence. Students are the ones who experience classrooms daily, navigate family constraints, and interact directly with teachers. Understanding how they interpret these influences offers a grounded, human lens for improving Mathematics education.</p>

            <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
            <p><strong>Design:</strong> Descriptive survey research</p>
            <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 240 Senior Secondary School Two (SSS2) students</p>
            <p><strong>Location:</strong> Six public secondary schools in Ethiope East Local Government Area, Delta State, Nigeria</p>
            <p><strong>Instrument:</strong> Structured questionnaire measuring student perceptions across five domains: parental educational background, teacher experience, teacher qualifications, family socioeconomic background, and cultural-linguistic context</p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            
            <div class="finding">
                <h3 class="finding-title">1. Teacher Quality Matters—A Lot</h3>
                <div class="key-point">
                    <strong>Teacher experience and professional qualification</strong> were identified as major influences on Mathematics performance.
                </div>
                <div class="key-point">
                    Experienced teachers were perceived as better at explaining concepts and managing classrooms.
                </div>
                <div class="key-point">
                    <strong>Important nuance:</strong> While qualified teachers were seen as more effective, they were <strong>not automatically seen as making students love Mathematics</strong>, highlighting a gap between instructional competence and student motivation.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="finding">
                <h3 class="finding-title">2. Family Income Shapes Opportunity</h3>
                <div class="key-point">
                    Students strongly associated <strong>low family income</strong> with difficulties in Mathematics learning.
                </div>
                <div class="key-point">
                    Key issues included inability to afford textbooks and learning materials, limited access to private study support, and stress caused by unmet basic needs.
                </div>
                <div class="key-point">
                    These findings reinforce that academic performance is not just about ability, but also about <strong>access and stability</strong>.

            <div class="finding">
                <h3 class="finding-title">3. Parental Education Helps—but Is Not Everything</h3>
                <div class="key-point">
                    Students perceived parental education as beneficial, especially when parents could assist with assignments, monitor school progress, and encourage academic effort.
                </div>
                <div class="key-point">
                    However, parental education alone was not viewed as determinative. Students from less-educated households did not automatically see themselves as disadvantaged.

            <div class="finding">

                <div class="key-point">
                    One of the most important findings is what students <strong>rejected</strong>.
                </div>
                <div class="key-point">
                    Most students disagreed that speaking local languages or Pidgin English at home causes poor academic performance.
                </div>
                <div class="key-point">
                    This challenges long-standing cultural-deficit narratives and suggests that students locate the problem in <strong>structural and instructional conditions</strong>, not in their identity or heritage.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote">
                Students do not view themselves or their backgrounds as the problem. They point instead to unequal access to resources, differences in teacher preparation, and economic constraints that limit learning opportunities.

            <h2>Implications for Education Policy and Practice</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Teacher development programs</strong> should prioritize both content mastery and motivational pedagogy.</li>
                <li><strong>Equity-focused interventions</strong>—such as learning material support for low-income students—are critical.</li>
                <li><strong>Culturally responsive teaching</strong> should be encouraged as an asset-based approach.</li>
                <li>Policymakers must recognize that improving Mathematics performance requires addressing <strong>economic and institutional factors</strong>, not cultural stereotypes.</li>
                <li>Future research should combine perception data with achievement outcomes and use longitudinal designs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="mt-3">Mathematics achievement is often treated as a purely academic problem. This study shows it is also a <strong>social and structural issue</strong>. When students speak, they tell a consistent story: quality teaching, economic support, and fair learning conditions matter more than culture or occupation. Listening to these voices is essential for building a more just and effective Mathematics education system in Nigeria.</p>
